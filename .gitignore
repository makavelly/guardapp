# How to write a line in a gitignore?
# These simple rule can make it easier to read and avoid name collision
#
# if it's a folder, add a final /
# if it's at the root folder, add a starting /
# if it's a sub-file or sub-folder add a starting */
# if you want to create an exception, add a starting !
#
# Examples:
# /dist/ (root folder)
# /node_modules/ (root folder)
# *.pyc (any file anywhere with .pyc extension)
# __pycache__/ (any folder anywhere with that name)

# The content of this file was downloaded from a python gitignore template on a GitHub
# Except for a /staticfiles/ and static/ folders of a Django project

# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/

# My own addition concerning static files in Django project
# Ignore staticfiles in the root directory
# / in the beginning means root
# Ignore it because you can easily create staticfiles with the command
# py manage.py collectstatic
/staticfiles/
# Ignore a folder containing css, js, img
static/

# Ignore packages downloaded with Yarn
